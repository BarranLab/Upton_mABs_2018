<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Appropriate characterisation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for therapeutic use is required to establish consistency in batch manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and to fulfil the concordant requirement to maintain critical quality attributes. The presence of post-translational modifications, which in turn can vary from lot to lot, results in heterogenic APIs at the primary sequence level and commensurate heterogeneity in their tertiary/quaternary active folds. For follow-on molecules distinguishing differences in the primary structure of the product as well as the effect this imparts to the intact API should be considered in an evaluation of biosimilarity. Here we present a systematic evaluation of three lots of Herceptin&reg;, and two mAb standards along with an intact Fc-hinge fragment. To consider the effect of glycosylation, each mAb is examined in three states; glycan intact, truncated (following endoS2 treatment) and fully deglycosylated. &nbsp;Mass spectrometry is used to evaluate the similarity of the mAbs and to probe the effect of glycosylation. Despite equivalence at the protein level, each lot of Herceptin&reg; gives a distinctive signature in three different mass spectrometry analyses.&nbsp; Collision cross section measurements from ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) show that in the API, glycosylation reduces the conformational spread of each mAb, which increases on glycan removal (10.5 &ndash; 25 %). Hydrogen/ deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) supports this, with a lower global deuterium uptake in solution when comparing intact to the fully deglycosylated protein. Following glycan truncation or removal, HDX-MS and activated IM-MS map the influence of this post-translational modification (PTM) on the mAb structure in both cases revealing allosteric effects which extend beyond the Fc-domains and into the Fab domain. Truncation to the chitobiose core results in a form of the mAbs that are highly flexible, possessing wider collision cross section profiles and higher deuterium uptake than either the intact or fully deglycosylated forms. Taken together these findings provide a route for MS based characterisation as well as the establishment of acceptance criteria for biosimilar and new therapeutic mAbs.</p>
